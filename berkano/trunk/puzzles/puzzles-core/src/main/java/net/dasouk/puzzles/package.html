<h3>Puzzles Terminology</h3>
<dl>
    <dt><strong>Package</strong></dt>
    <dd>A package is a file containing everything the plugin needs. In most cases
    the package will be a zip or jar file, containing images, css files, jar files, etc.</dd>
    <dt><strong>PackageReader</strong></dt>
    <dd>A PackageReader is an object that knows to read inside a package, and access the files it contains.
    As long as you use plugins packaged as zip/jar files, you only need to use the
    ZipPackageReader that comes bundled with Puzzles.</dd>
    <dt><strong>PluginStore</strong></dt>
    <dd>A PluginStore is a repository where the plugins' packages (zip/jar files mainly) will be saved.
    Most commonly, the store will be a folder on the local file system.</dd>
    <dt><strong>PluginDescriptor</strong></dt>
    <dd>The PluginDescriptor is metainformation about the plugin. It contains information about the name of the plugin,
    the author, a URL where more information can be found, but also specifies how to instanciate the plugin (in case
    the plugin contains java code) and the public resources of the plugin. By "Public resources", we refer to any file
    in the package that are to be available outside of the plugin's scope: typically, you don't want the jar libraries
    to be available, so you won't declare them as public resource. But if your plugin contains images that you want to
    display in a web application, the image will have to be declared as a public resource.</dd>
    <dt><strong>PluginDescriptorBuilder</strong></dt>
    <dd>This is an object that is able to build a PluginDescriptor instance from a file. So far, Puzzles
    only comes with a PluginDescriptorBuilder that builds descriptors from java's properties files.</dd>
    <dt><strong>PluginLoader</strong></dt>
    <dd>A PluginLoader has two roles: the first one is to be a front-end to the PackageReader and
        PluginDescriptorBuilder, so that higher level objects don't have to deal with the Package/Descriptor stuff.
        The second role is to load the jar dependencies of the plugin (if there are any) and to instanciate the Plugin
        itself.</dd>
    <dt><strong>PluginRegistry</strong></dt>
    <dd>The PluginRegistry is what you'll deal with: it hides the Storing/Loading/Reading/etc. from you. It knows which
        plugins are installed, it knows how to give you URLs to the plugins' resources, it can install new plugins,
        uninstall previously installed plugins, etc., it notifies its listeners when plugins are installed or
        uninstalled.</dd>
    <dt><strong>PluginListener</strong></dt>
    <dd>Any object that implements this interface and that is added to the registry's PluginListeners will be notified
    when a plugin is installed/uninstalled.</dd>
