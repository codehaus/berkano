Stuff to be done on berkano/berkano-skeleton
---------------------------------------
* Define a way to get anonymous-user (or "default") BookmarksTree, or even more
  generaly a way to get "anonymous-user" stuff ?

* A user's bookmarks could be set in session so that we could store the state
  of each node.

* Implement actions for self-bookmarks handling but also for the admin user to
  modify other users or groups' bookmarks. (+the defaults/anonymous-user's)

* bookmarks: ability to "include" bookmarks? (for user/group bookmarks for example)

* permissions to edit : self-bookmarks, group-bookmarks or all-bookmarks
  (specific-groups' bookmarks, specific-users' bookmarks???)

* have a "domain" prefix for permissions, something like "berkano/bookmark/self-add",
  "berkano/bookmark/self-edit", "berkano/usermgt/blah", "myapp/myaction/foobar"

* provide simple access to the cache? (mention it's very simple and not meant for
  storing lots of data etc) Maybe through a simple component on which actions
  depend.

Stuff done:
------------------------------------
* Implemented security/permissions : 
        * Permissions are the smallest unit of security. they are represented by 
          a String, their name. The permissions are the unit which are checked to
          to make sure a user has access to a given resource or can perform a 
          certain action.
        * Roles are groups of permissions. They are mostly defined *by* the 
          software itself, but could, should it be needed, be defined by config
          files or else. The roles are assigned to groups by an admin user.
        * Groups
        * Users
 
* Check how webwork stuff can be distributed. I guess it's possible to
  distribute a jar with xwork xml config inside, and have it included from the
  main. If so, then we can split the actions for bookmarks into a separate
  project, same thing for user mgt. --> done for user-mgt


* provide multiple-users/multi-groups assignments. provide real groups/roles
  assignements (there are currently 2 roles hardcoded in the view, and the checkboxes
  are not check accordingly)
